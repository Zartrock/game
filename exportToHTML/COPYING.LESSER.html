<a name="l25"><span class="ln">25   </span></a><span class="s0">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</span>
<a name="l26"><span class="ln">26   </span></a><span class="s0">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations</span>
<a name="l27"><span class="ln">27   </span></a><span class="s0">below.</span>
<a name="l28"><span class="ln">28   </span></a>
<a name="l29"><span class="ln">29   </span></a>  <span class="s0">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</span>
<a name="l30"><span class="ln">30   </span></a><span class="s0">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</span>
<a name="l31"><span class="ln">31   </span></a><span class="s0">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</span>
<a name="l32"><span class="ln">32   </span></a><span class="s0">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</span>
<a name="l33"><span class="ln">33   </span></a><span class="s0">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</span>
<a name="l34"><span class="ln">34   </span></a><span class="s0">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</span>
<a name="l35"><span class="ln">35   </span></a><span class="s0">these things.</span>
<a name="l36"><span class="ln">36   </span></a>
<a name="l37"><span class="ln">37   </span></a>  <span class="s0">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span>
<a name="l38"><span class="ln">38   </span></a><span class="s0">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</span>
<a name="l39"><span class="ln">39   </span></a><span class="s0">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</span>
<a name="l40"><span class="ln">40   </span></a><span class="s0">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</span>
<a name="l41"><span class="ln">41   </span></a>
<a name="l42"><span class="ln">42   </span></a>  <span class="s0">For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</span>
<a name="l43"><span class="ln">43   </span></a><span class="s0">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</span>
<a name="l44"><span class="ln">44   </span></a><span class="s0">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</span>
<a name="l45"><span class="ln">45   </span></a><span class="s0">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</span>
<a name="l46"><span class="ln">46   </span></a><span class="s0">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</span>
<a name="l47"><span class="ln">47   </span></a><span class="s0">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</span>
<a name="l48"><span class="ln">48   </span></a><span class="s0">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span>
<a name="l49"><span class="ln">49   </span></a>
<a name="l50"><span class="ln">50   </span></a>  <span class="s0">We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</span>
<a name="l51"><span class="ln">51   </span></a><span class="s0">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</span>
<a name="l52"><span class="ln">52   </span></a><span class="s0">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</span>
<a name="l53"><span class="ln">53   </span></a>
<a name="l54"><span class="ln">54   </span></a>  <span class="s0">To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</span>
<a name="l55"><span class="ln">55   </span></a><span class="s0">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</span>
<a name="l56"><span class="ln">56   </span></a><span class="s0">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</span>
<a name="l57"><span class="ln">57   </span></a><span class="s0">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</span>
<a name="l58"><span class="ln">58   </span></a><span class="s0">author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</span>
<a name="l59"><span class="ln">59   </span></a><span class="s0">introduced by others.</span>
<a name="l60"><span class="ln">60   </span></a>
<a name="l61"><span class="ln">61   </span></a>  <span class="s0">Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</span>
<a name="l62"><span class="ln">62   </span></a><span class="s0">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</span>
<a name="l63"><span class="ln">63   </span></a><span class="s0">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</span>
<a name="l64"><span class="ln">64   </span></a><span class="s0">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</span>
<a name="l65"><span class="ln">65   </span></a><span class="s0">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</span>
<a name="l66"><span class="ln">66   </span></a><span class="s0">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</span>
<a name="l67"><span class="ln">67   </span></a>
<a name="l68"><span class="ln">68   </span></a>  <span class="s0">Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</span>
<a name="l69"><span class="ln">69   </span></a><span class="s0">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</span>
<a name="l70"><span class="ln">70   </span></a><span class="s0">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</span>
<a name="l71"><span class="ln">71   </span></a><span class="s0">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</span>
<a name="l72"><span class="ln">72   </span></a><span class="s0">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</span>
<a name="l73"><span class="ln">73   </span></a><span class="s0">libraries into non-free programs.</span>
<a name="l74"><span class="ln">74   </span></a>
<a name="l75"><span class="ln">75   </span></a>  <span class="s0">When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</span>
<a name="l76"><span class="ln">76   </span></a><span class="s0">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</span>
<a name="l77"><span class="ln">77   </span></a><span class="s0">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</span>
<a name="l78"><span class="ln">78   </span></a><span class="s0">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</span>
<a name="l79"><span class="ln">79   </span></a><span class="s0">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</span>
<a name="l80"><span class="ln">80   </span></a><span class="s0">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</span>
<a name="l81"><span class="ln">81   </span></a><span class="s0">the library.</span>
<a name="l82"><span class="ln">82   </span></a>
<a name="l83"><span class="ln">83   </span></a>  <span class="s0">We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</span>
<a name="l84"><span class="ln">84   </span></a><span class="s0">does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General</span>
<a name="l85"><span class="ln">85   </span></a><span class="s0">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</span>
<a name="l86"><span class="ln">86   </span></a><span class="s0">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</span>
<a name="l87"><span class="ln">87   </span></a><span class="s0">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</span>
<a name="l88"><span class="ln">88   </span></a><span class="s0">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</span>
<a name="l89"><span class="ln">89   </span></a><span class="s0">special circumstances.</span>
<a name="l90"><span class="ln">90   </span></a>
<a name="l91"><span class="ln">91   </span></a>  <span class="s0">For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</span>
<a name="l92"><span class="ln">92   </span></a><span class="s0">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it</span>
<a name="l93"><span class="ln">93   </span></a><span class="s0">becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must</span>
<a name="l94"><span class="ln">94   </span></a><span class="s0">be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</span>
<a name="l95"><span class="ln">95   </span></a><span class="s0">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</span>
<a name="l96"><span class="ln">96   </span></a><span class="s0">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</span>
<a name="l97"><span class="ln">97   </span></a><span class="s0">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</span>
<a name="l98"><span class="ln">98   </span></a>
<a name="l99"><span class="ln">99   </span></a>  <span class="s0">In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</span>
<a name="l100"><span class="ln">100  </span></a><span class="s0">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</span>
<a name="l101"><span class="ln">101  </span></a><span class="s0">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</span>
<a name="l102"><span class="ln">102  </span></a><span class="s0">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</span>
<a name="l103"><span class="ln">103  </span></a><span class="s0">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</span>
<a name="l104"><span class="ln">104  </span></a><span class="s0">system.</span>
<a name="l105"><span class="ln">105  </span></a>
<a name="l106"><span class="ln">106  </span></a>  <span class="s0">Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</span>
<a name="l107"><span class="ln">107  </span></a><span class="s0">users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</span>
<a name="l108"><span class="ln">108  </span></a><span class="s0">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</span>
<a name="l109"><span class="ln">109  </span></a><span class="s0">that program using a modified version of the Library.</span>

<a name="l115"><span class="ln">115  </span></a><span class="s0">be combined with the library in order to run.</span>
